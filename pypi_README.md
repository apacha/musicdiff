# musicdiff
A Python3 package (and command-line tool) for computing and visualizing the differences between two music scores.

musicdiff is derived from: [music-score-diff](https://github.com/fosfrancesco/music-score-diff.git)
    by [Francesco Foscarin](https://github.com/fosfrancesco).

## Setup
Depends on music21 (best with v7) and numpy. You also will need to configure music21 to display a musical score (e.g. with MuseScore).

## Usage
On the command line:

    python3 -m musicdiff file1.musicxml file2.krn

    positional arguments:
      file1       first music score file to compare (any format music21 can parse)
      file2       second music score file to compare (any format music21 can parse)

The musicdiff command line tool will display two rendered score PDFs that have the differences highlighted with color and descriptive text.

## Documentation
If you want to call musicdiff APIs in your own code, there is a high-level diff() API that the command-line tool uses (that you can customize the behavior of) as well as lower level APIs that you can use in projects that perhaps want to do something other than visualization via PDF. You can find the musicdiff API documentation [here](https://gregchapman-dev.github.io/musicdiff).
