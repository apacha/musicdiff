# musicdiff
A Python3 package for computing and visualizing the differences between two music scores.

musicdiff is derived from: [music-score-diff[(https://github.com/fosfrancesco/music-score-diff.git)
    by [Francesco Foscarin](https://github.com/fosfrancesco)

## Setup
Depends on music21. After installing music21 you also will need to set it up to display a musical score (e.g. with MuseScore).

## Usage
A music file comparison tool based on musicdiff is available in [comparescores.py](comparescores.py).  You can use it as a tool, or as example code for adding musicdiff capabilities to your own code.
